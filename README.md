### Build status - Mac Os X, clang
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/audiofilter/spuc.png)](https://travis-ci.org/audiofilter/spuc)


This is an update of code that has been on sourceforge for about 14 years. Since it has not compiled for modern compilers for several years, this update was to most fix compiler errors and other bugs found in more real-life testing
For now this is merely an update and is sorely lacking in other documentation and / or examples.
While everything should compile without warnings on GCC 4.8 and Clang 3.3, not all examples are functional
